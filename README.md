# Cryptocurrencies

# Overview

For this task we were helping our friends out to determine which crypto is the best and most active. Because we did not know the output, we were going to use unsupervised machine learning. This will allow us to determine the best output. Unsurpervised learning can be very needy. The most important part within unsupervised learning is to make sure your data is very clean. We used pandas to clean and create new data frames. Next, we used the elbow plot to determine the number of clusters to input into our model. After the model, we ploted some 3d plots to visualize our clustered output data. Below are some screenshots of project. Lastly, we were able to plot two outcomes based off of total coins mined vs total coin supply. This predication will make sure the coin we select is both current and has future availability.
